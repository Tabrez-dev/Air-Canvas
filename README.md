# Air Canvas Project

## Overview

The Air Canvas project is an interactive digital art creation platform that leverages real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition. This project integrates the capabilities of the MediaPipe and OpenCV frameworks to enable users to draw on a virtual canvas using intuitive hand movements.

## Features

- **Hand Tracking**: The project utilizes the MediaPipe framework for real-time hand tracking, accurately detecting and tracking hand landmarks.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Gesture recognition enables users to control the drawing process through natural hand movements.
- **Color Selection**: Users can choose different ink colors for drawing on the canvas.
- **Web Interface**: The project features a web-based interface developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Performance Metrics**: Performance metrics, including latency, Frames Per Second (FPS), CPU usage, and memory usage, are visualized in a graph.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- MediaPipe
- OpenCV
- Flask (Backend)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Web Interface)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask application using `python app.py`.
4. Open the provided URL in your web browser to access the Air Canvas.

## Usage

- Click on the "Run Air Canvas" button to start the drawing interface.
- Select different ink colors and use natural hand movements to draw on the canvas.
- Press 'q' to exit the Air Canvas and view performance metrics.
